# BaBaozi - simple flashcards
https://suiseki.github.io/babaozi/

This is a simple app, based on a flash version I wrote a few years ago. All cards are stored in a text file. User clicks several buttons to draw a card and show Chinese characters, pronunciation or translation.

## Feature list
- parse json character base
- draw random Chinese word
- draw random pronunciation
- draw random translation
- show first, next and previous word in the dictionary
- search by word index or by character
- find all occurrences of searched Chinese characters

## Javascript conventions
One of the purposes I this project is to try some coding concepts in practice. I started with basic vanilla javascript and after adding all functionality I wanted to express this using design patterns.
Various development approaches will be left for comparison purposes.

### Implemented patterns
- Object Literal
- Module Pattern
- Revealing Module Pattern

### Planned patterns
- Constructor Pattern

### Planned changes
- ES6 syntax
- npm scripts for building process
